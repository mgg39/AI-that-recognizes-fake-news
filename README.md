LSTM network designed to recognize Fake news from "True" news.
This repository constructs and trains a deep learning model, as well as performs:
exploratory data analysis,
plot word-cloud, 
text data cleaning,
tokenization on text corpus to feed deep learning model,
padding on text corpus to feed deep learning model,
and performance of the trained model.
